SP News was developed for serving as a personal news app in which users, from all parts of life, can partake in viewing news articles of their preferenced categories throughout their day.

SP News utilizes an API from newsfeed.api for content delivery. Our application offers several article categories consisting of: Business, Entertainment, General, Health, Science, Sports, and Technology.

For those of you that do not read articles in one-go, fret not, users can favorite articles (which allows the article to remain permanently on their newsfeed).

Users can also follow other users who are utilizing the application, and also view which articles are the hottest at the moment.
